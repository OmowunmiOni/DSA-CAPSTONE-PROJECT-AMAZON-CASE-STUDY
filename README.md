# DSA CAPSTONE PROJECT - AMAZON CASE STUDY
This project is aimed at analysing Amazon's sales data in order to identify trends, challenges and opportunities. This project is an exploratory Excel analysis of Amazon product listings using sales, pricing, and review data. It was completed as part of a data learning path focused on building core skills in spreadsheet analysis and business insights. I used data analysis techniques and tools to gain insights into customer behaviour, products performance and market trends.

## Objectives
- To analyze Amazon's sales data to identify top-selling products and categories
- To identify trends and patterns in customer behaviour and product performance
- To develop recommendations for Amazon to improve sales and customer satisfaction

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
- Pivot Tables
- Formulas (e.g., IF, COUNTIF, AVERAGE)
- Sorting & Filtering
- Data Bucketing

### Methodology
To achieve the objectives of this project, I employed the following methodology:

### Data collection
- Amazon sales data was collected from publicly available sources

### Data Processing
- Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy
- Handled missing values and removing duplicates using suitable imputation and outlier detection methods
- Converted data types as necessary

### Data Analysis
- Used descriptive statistics to summarize sales data and identify trends
- Applied visualisation techniques (e.g. bar charts, scatter charts) to illustrate key findings
- Conducted correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables

### Tools and Techniques
- Excel: data cleaning, data visualisation and statistical analysis
- Data visualisation libraries to create interactive dashboards and visualizations

### Limitations
- Data quality issues (e.g. missing values, ouliers) may impact analysis result
- The analysis is limited to publicly available data and may not reflect Amazon's entire product catalog or customer base.

### üîç Key Analyses

- Grouped products into price range buckets (e.g. `<¬£200`, `¬£200-¬£500`)
- Counted unique products per price tier
- Identified products with fewer than 1,000 reviews
- Created pivot tables to summarize by:
  - Product category
  - Review count ranges
  - Price groups
- Visualized trends and product concentration

### üí° Insights & Observations

- Certain categories dominate the mid-range price tiers
- Low-review products may require marketing or visibility efforts
- High-value products are concentrated in fewer categories
- 
### - Customer behavior: 
- Customers who purchased products in the Electronics category are more likely to also purchase products in the Home and Kitchen category
- The level of discount directly impacts on product sales (i.e. the higher the discount, the highr the number of products sold)

### Recommendations
- Product assortment: Amazon should prioritize stocking top-selling products and categories to meet customer demand
- Cross-selling: Amazon can leverage customer behavior insights to recommend related products and increase average order value
